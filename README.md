## Motivation
Oral cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, with high prevalence and mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to late-stage detection, reducing survival rates. This project explores the use of deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and speed of oral cancer diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of oral cancer images, the goal is to:
- Analyze and understand the characteristics of the dataset.
- Apply conventional machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM, KNN, Random Forest) for image classification.
- Implement deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, LSTMs, GANs) to improve classification accuracy.
- Compare the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of high-resolution images categorized into cancerous and non-cancerous classes. These images are used for training and evaluating the models. Key challenges include imbalanced data, image quality variability, and limited data availability.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Analysis
- Analyze the dataset to understand image characteristics, class distribution, and preprocessing requirements.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- Implement traditional machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and Random Forest.
- Evaluate and compare their performance in classifying oral cancer images.

### 3. Deep Learning Models
- Apply deep learning architectures like CNNs, LSTMs, and GANs.
- Perform a comparative assessment of these architectures to determine their effectiveness.

## Performance Measures
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**
- **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)**

## Results
- The project achieved a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy using deep learning models compared to traditional methods.
- Detailed results and performance graphs are provided in the project documentation.

## Conclusion and Future Enhancements
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning models in enhancing the early detection of oral cancer. Future work includes expanding the dataset, improving model robustness, and exploring explainable AI techniques for better model interpretability.
